### Dumelang 👋
 
I am a Master of Science student in Biological Sciences at the University of Cape Town, specializing in ecological spatial modeling. My research focuses on applying spatial data analysis techniques to model species distribution and understand the ecological factors influencing them. In addition, I explore the same methods to analyze societal phenomena like crime rates and disease spread, using data science and machine learning approaches to uncover meaningful patterns. This interdisciplinary work bridges biology, geography, and data science to solve complex real-world problems.

🔭 I’m currently working on mapping endemic flora in the Cape floristic region using GIS tools.

## My Projects

Here are some projects I've been working on:

- [Project Name](https://github.com/Boemokg/GIS-mapping):
  Mapping endemic floral in the cape floristic region using GIS tools. Generating a map for this but also generating a map of the haibitat association. This can either be faculatative wetland-dependent, obligate wetland dependent.
  
- [Project Name](https://github.com/Boemokg/Stress-in-the-city-):
  Validating a method of mesuring stress hormones (glucocorticoid) in medium sized birds (Red-winged starlings) ciculating in the the blood vs in the feacal samples. Lastly, proof of concept, to test the stress with on birds on campus on days where there are humans (weekday) and on days when humans are absent (weekends)
