## My Projects

Here are some projects I've been working on:

- [Project Name](https://github.com/Boemokg/GIS-mapping):
  Mapping endemic floral in the cape floristic region using GIS tools. Generating a map for this but also generating a map of the haibitat association. This can either be faculatative wetland-dependent, obligate wetland dependent.
  
- [Project Name](https://github.com/Boemokg/Stress-in-the-city-):
  Validating a method of mesuring stress hormones (glucocorticoid) in medium sized birds (Red-winged starlings) ciculating in the the blood vs in the feacal samples. Lastly, proof of concept, to test the stress with on birds on campus on days where there are humans (weekday) and on days when humans are absent (weekends)
